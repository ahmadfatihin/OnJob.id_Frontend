# OnJob.id_Frontend

Created using React Native

``npm install`` (Install dependencies)

``react-native start`` (start development server)

``react native run-android`` (make sure there is an android virtual emulator or android device connected to your device)

sometimes error occurs due to difference of folder name when calling classes from modules, try changing these name.
if the error still occurs run ``react-native start --reset-cache``
or just google it
